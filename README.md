# Module 2 -  Hypothesis Testing - Northwind database

The goal of the project is to query the Northwind database to get the data needed to perform a statistical analysis. In this statistical analysis, a hypothesis test will be perfomed to answer the following questions:

Filename:  Student_HypothesisI.pynb
Hypothesis I : Does discount have a significant effect on quantity of an order?


Filename:  Student_HypothesisII.pynb
Hypothesis II : Does discount have a significant effect on total price paid on an order?

Filename:  Student_HypothesisIII.pynb
Hypothesis III : Does the order month have a significant effect on the total spent on orders for that month?

Filename:  Student_HypothesisIV.pynb
Hypothesis IV : Does the order month have a significant effect on the quantity on orders for that month?
Furthermore, it will be specified if this is one-tail or a two-tail test.

Project Completion Date:  02/03/2020
